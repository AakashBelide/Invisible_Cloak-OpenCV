# Invisible_Cloak-OpenCV

You can use a piece of cloth or any object to act like the invisible cloak from the Harry Potter series.

background.py: Begin by running this file and click q to save the background image.

invisible_cloak.py: The target colour is red, hence whenever you use a red coloured object, it'll hide that part of the video and replace it with the background image which you have stored earlier.

You will get better results if you use in a fixed background (no movinf objects).
